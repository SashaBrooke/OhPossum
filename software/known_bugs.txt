    Input 'gimbal-stream=f' causes streaming to be disabled
    likely due to how atoi() handles non-integer inputs. Consider
    using a different parsing method or handle cases where 
    non-integer inputs are entered.

    Input 'gimbal-stream=' causes streaming to be disabled.
    Probably for a similar reason to above issue.

    Similar behaviour with gimbal-streamrate, gimbal-serialno 
    and pan-setpos.

    If numeric is encountered first (e.g. 1fflsjd), atoi()
    reads only the numeric part as a valid input (probably
    not desirable). Input with embedded numeric (e.g. edf1df)
    considered invalid (good behaviour).
